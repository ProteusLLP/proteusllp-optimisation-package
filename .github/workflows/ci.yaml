# CI/CD pipeline for Proteus Optimizer Package
#
# This workflow runs tests and builds the package using Docker containers
# to ensure consistency with the development environment.
#
# Triggers:
# - Push/PR: Runs tests only for code validation
# - GitHub Release: Runs full pipeline (test → build → publish to PyPI)
#
# Jobs:
# - docker-build: Builds CI image once and shares it across jobs
# - test: Runs pytest with coverage using the shared CI Docker image
# - build: Builds Python package (release only)
# - pypi-publish: Publishes to PyPI using trusted publishing (release only)
#
# To release: Create a GitHub Release, which triggers automatic PyPI publishing.

# POP Examples

This directory contains working examples demonstrating the Proteus Optimisation Package (POP) capabilities.

## 📁 Available Examples

### Basic Examples
- **`simple_portfolio.py`** - Basic two-asset portfolio optimization
- **`risk_return_tradeoff.py`** - Computing efficient frontier
- **`constrained_optimization.py`** - Using equality and inequality constraints

### Advanced Examples
- **`composite_metrics.py`** - Sharpe ratio and custom composite objectives
- **`freqsev_optimization.py`** - Working with frequency-severity simulations
- **`multi_objective.py`** - Multiple objectives with different risk measures

## 🚀 Running Examples

```bash
# In devcontainer or with PDM
pdm run python examples/simple_portfolio.py

# Or directly
python examples/simple_portfolio.py
```

## 📚 Learning Path

1. Start with `simple_portfolio.py` - understand basic optimization
2. Try `risk_return_tradeoff.py` - see efficient frontiers
3. Explore `constrained_optimization.py` - add constraints
4. Advanced: `composite_metrics.py` and `freqsev_optimization.py`

Each example is self-contained and includes detailed comments explaining the concepts.
